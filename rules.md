# ![butterfly](img/butterfly32.png) Witches gameboard of deduction ![butterfly](img/butterfly32.png)
Welcome to Rokkenjima. On this mysterious island, both a treasure trove of gold and a bloodthirsty murderer lie waiting.

In this hidden role/social deduction game, players step into the shoes of the Ushiromiya family on October 5th, 1986, as they search for the island’s hidden gold while a string of murders slowly whittle down their numbers.

The game is split into two phases, similarly to Mafia’s day/night cycle. However, the two phases are known here as the exploration phase and the deduction phase.

## Exploration phase
Players secretly choose one of the island’s 10 locations to visit in search of the gold. Only by searching through all 10 locations will a player be able to locate this hidden treasure. While searching, players can also have private conversations with anyone else in the same location, but it’s important to be wary of others. This phase is also the witch’s opportunity to strike. When Beatrice has made her decision of whom to kill (or to kill nobody) the exploration phase ends and the deduction phase begins.

## Deduction phase
The players all gather in the parlour to discuss the evidence, make accusations, and shoot potential culprits, in the hope of eliminating Beatrice and ending her string of murders. The deduction phase continues until somebody is shot with Kinzo’s gun, or a decision is made to shoot nobody. After this, another exploration phase begins.

### Kinzo's gun
The person killed during the deduction phase is not chosen by a majority vote. Instead, Kinzo’s Gun is the method through which the humans can fight back against Beatrice.
After the first death, the players will elect a person to be in charge of the Kinzo's gun. This player has complete control over who is shot at the end of any deduction phase. However, another vote can be called at any time by any player to give the gun to somebody else.

## Goals
The humans’ side wins when Beatrice dies or when the gold is found after having explored all of the locations.  
The witch’s side wins when everyone except for Beatrice is dead.

## Special Roles
There are 5 different special roles that are randomly assigned at the start of every game: Beatrice, the Accomplice(s), the Illusion, the Witch’s Opponent and the Detective.

+ **Beatrice** is the villain of this game. During the exploration phase, Beatrice can kill anybody in the same location as her, but only if the number of her and her accomplices in that location is equal to or greater than the number of the innocents.

+ **Accomplices** cannot kill. Their task is to work together with and protect Beatrice. There is a private chat for Beatrice, Accomplices and the Illusion to plan their actions in. Accomplices can be killed by Beatrice at any time.

+ **The Illusion** is a character who is dead from the start of the game. However Beatrice can disguise herself as them when she wishes to. In practice, this means that Beatrice can instruct the Illusion to perform actions during the exploration phase, however this means that she cannot act herself during that phase and vice versa. Both Beatrice and the Illusion can appear in the deduction phase.

+ **The Witch’s Opponent** is a human player who can request confirmation in red of one statement in each deduction phase through the game master. Beatrice can respond by confirming, refusing to confirm, or giving an unrelated red truth. [_work in progress_]

+ **The Detective** has no powers at first, but after making a public detective proclamation during a deduction phase, they can begin to make use of their detective’s authority. This allows them to see if anyone in the same room as them drops a letter. After the Detective makes their proclamation, the Illusion will be exposed and disappear. The Detective cannot fire Kinzo’s gun, but can hold it.

## Character Roles [_work in progress_]
Whether or not they have a special role, each player will be assigned a character to play as, which will be publicly known. This game is not a roleplay, so you are not expected to speak or act in character. Instead, the character you are given determines your _secondary objective_.

Secondary objectives are a way to make things more interesting for players without a special role. They provide a second objective for each player to accomplish alongside their attempts to survive and find the gold. The characters’ primary objectives should always be to survive and find the culprit (except if it is in conflict with the secondary role), but these secondary goals can be thought of like bonus points to work towards getting.

### Character-specific Secondary Goals:

+ **Kinzo**: Be alive at the point that the number of players on the witch’s side is equal to or greater than the number of players on the humans’ side.
+ **Krauss**: Don’t let any other players find the gold.
+ **Natsuhi**: Do not allow the Illusion to be discovered.
+ **Jessica**: _TBD_
+ **Eva**: Have Natsuhi die during the deduction phase.
+ **Hideyoshi**: Do not allow Eva or George to shoot or be shot with Kinzo’s gun (exception  only if Eva/George is Beatrice).
+ **George**: Spend one exploration phase alone with Shannon.
+ **Rudolf**: Spend one exploration phase alone with Kyrie and Battler.
+ **Kyrie**: Battler is killed by Beatrice.
+ **Battler**: Kill Beatrice while the accomplice still lives.
+ **Rosa**: Survive alongside Maria.
+ **Maria**: Have both yourself and Rosa die in one round.
+ **Shannon**: Spend one exploration phase alone with Battler.
+ **Kanon**: Prevent Shannon’s death.
+ **Kumasawa**: _TBD_
+ **Gohda**: _TBD_
+ **Nanjo**: Examine every location where a dead body has been found.
+ **Genji**: Must move according to the orders of whoever holds Kinzo’s gun.
(The lack of agency in this role means that it can be used by the gamemaster to increase the number of players by joining themselves without their knowledge having a significant impact on the game, and thus it can be removed from the pool of roles for actual players.)
+ **Erika**: Expose the Illusion and Accomplice before Beatrice.

And that concludes the rules of Umineko: Witches’ Gameboard of Deduction!


## Rule Update 1 - Witch's Letters
During the exploration phase, Beatrice or the Accomplice may drop a letter bearing the Ushiromiya Family Crest on the floor. This brings suspicion to the room, and forces all players to split up and move to a new location without discussing it beforehand. However, if the Detective is present, they will see who drops the letter.

## Rule Update 2 - Secondary Goals

+ (Updated)**Kinzo**: Be alive at the point that the number of players on the witch’s side is equal to or greater than the number of players on the humans’ side.
+ (New)**Nanjo**: Examine every location where a dead body has been found.
+ (New)**Hideyoshi**: Do not allow Eva or George to shoot or be shot with Kinzo’s gun (exception  only if Eva/George is Beatrice).
